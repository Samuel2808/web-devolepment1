    <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
    <p>Hello, My name is Samuel Santana. I am a 20-year-old student studying programming at Columbia College of Chicago. It's my first year of college and I hope to complete all of them here at Columbia. I hope to specialize in the programming area since it is something that I like and I am really passionate about. I plan to continue my studies after being at Columbia in the UK</p>
