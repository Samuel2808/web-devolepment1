    <h1 class="sttitle">About it</h1>
    <h1 class="FanText1">Star Wars is an American epic space opera media franchise created by George Lucas, 
        which began with the eponymous 1977 film and quickly became a worldwide pop culture phenomenon. 
        The franchise has been expanded into various films and other media, including television series,
        video games,
        novels, comic books, theme park attractions, and themed areas, comprising an all-encompassing fictional
        universe. Star Wars is one of the highest-grossing media
        franchises of all time. The universe of Star Wars is generally similar to the real universe but its
        laws of physics are less strict allowing for more imaginative stories. 
        One result of that is a mystical power known as the Force which is described in the original film as "an energy
        field created by all living things ... 
        [that] binds the galaxy together". The field is depicted as a kind of pantheistic god. Through training and
        meditation, those whom "the Force is strong with" 
        exhibit various superpowers (such as telekinesis, precognition, telepathy, and manipulation of physical energy).
        It is believed nothing is impossible for the Force. 
        The mentioned powers are wielded by two major knightly orders at conflict with each other: the Jedi, 
        peacekeepers of the Galactic Republic who act on the light side of the Force through non-attachment and
        arbitration, and the Sith, who use the dark side by manipulating fear and aggression. 
        While Jedi Knights can be numerous, the Dark Lords of the Sith (or 'Darths') are intended to be limited to two:
        a master and their apprentice.</h1>
